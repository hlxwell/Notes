# Don't block the reactor
1. while(1) or while(true)
2. Net::HTTP.new("")
Use EM::HttpRequest instead.
3. Slow Code
Use EM.defer to optimze.
4. Sleep will block

# Everything should be in the EM.run {} block

# EM.start_server ip, port, EM::Connection Class
to create a em connection server.

# EM::Connection
*post_init* method will be executed when connection is built.
*unbind* method will be called when connection is closed or disconnected.
*receive_Data(data)* called with chunks of data.
*send_data* method is used to send data to client.

# EM Client
EM.connect(ip, port, EM::Connection)

# EM.stop
??? the code after this still will be executed.

# EM.next_tick

# EM.add_timer(time) {}

# EM.add_periodic_timer(time) {}

# EM.defer {} runs a block concurrently on a sperate thread (from a pool of 20)

# EM.defer(operation, completion_callback)

# EM::Queue
queue.pop {}
queue.push(data)

# Endless queue
work = Proc.new { |item|
  EM.next_tick {q.pop(&work)}
}
q.pop(&work)

# EM::Channel
is a publish/subscribe system.
* c = EM::Channel.new
* sid = c.subscribe { |m| to process message }
* c.unsubscribe(sid)
* c << data or message

# EM::Deferrable
* deferrable object can register *callback* and *errback*
deferrable.callback {}
deferrable.callback {|x, y, z|} // any number of args
deferrable.errback {}
deferrable.set_deferred_status :succeeded
* To trigger the callback by calling:
deferrable.succeed
deferrable.fail

# UDP
* Server:
EM.open_datagram_socket(ip, port, handler_class)
* Client:
s = EM.open_datagram_socket('', nil)
s.send_datagram(data, ip, port)

# Unix domain server
* Create server:
EM.start_server('/tmp/server', nil, handler_class)
EM.start_unix_domain_server('/tmp/server', nil, handler_class)
* Connect to server:
EM.connect_unix_domain("/tmp/server") do |c|
  c.send_data(data)
end

# WebSocket
* Server
EM::WebSocket.start(:host => x, :port => x) do |ws|
  ws.onopen {}
  ws.onmessage {|msg| ws.send(data) // send data to browser }
  ws.onclose {}
  ws.onerror {|e| }
end

# EM::Synchrony
Just help you to make the code looks like normal flow but not callback hell.
